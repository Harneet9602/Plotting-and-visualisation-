Plotting and Visualization in Python

This repository features a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates 2D and 3D plotting techniques using `matplotlib`, one of Pythonâ€™s most powerful libraries for data visualization.


 ðŸ“˜ Whatâ€™s Inside

The notebook walks through a variety of visualizations:

 ðŸ“ˆ 2D Plots
- Line plots of polynomial functions (linear, quadratic, cubic)
- Custom labels, titles, and legends
- Use of `plt.subplots()` and `plt.figure()` for layout control

 ðŸŒ€ 3D Plots
- 3D surface plots using `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d`
- Visualization of mathematical surfaces like sine waves and meshgrids
- `ax.plot_surface()` and related 3D tools
